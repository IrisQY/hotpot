northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\"."," And now, the Terminal splits into two parts."," The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood."," The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while."," This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line."," The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2."," Speed is now increased to 40."," Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance."," Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line."," At 00J3.6 known as A-1."," Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9)."," Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line."," At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\"."," At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill."," There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track."," And there is also a connection\/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad."," Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard."," Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10."," Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192."," The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use."," The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs."," At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1."," Speed is now at 40."," 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present."," This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main."," There is a single departure\/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track."," Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains."," This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent."," From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the
